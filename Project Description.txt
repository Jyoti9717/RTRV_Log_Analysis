=====Description======

Installed optical device on server records event logs in text form. 
The sample text file of recorded log is availble in sample folder in uploaded project.

The Log Analysis Tool has multiple features.However I have uploded one sample feature where user upload log text file and select a date and time (HH:MM) to analyse incident logs.




Required Postman.
I have uploaded flask app which is advisable to test with Postman.

List of required libraries is mentioned in Requirement.txt file.

How it works :
Upload Test.txt(Log file) - input date and time - output file generated and saved in "/static/download_file/filename.csv



How to test:
  While testing the code 4 inputs required -
    1- Upload Test.txt file  (Select test data from "/sample file " folder)
    
    2- select date(Key-"selected_date") in "yyyy-mm-dd" form  
       example-  "2020-08-15" (test file contains single day incident log)
      
    3- select hours (Key -"selected_hours") in "HH" (0-23)
       example -Hours : "01"
    
    4-select minutes (Key - "selected_minutes") in "MM" (1-59)
        example - Minutes : "46"
EXECUTE

Output in csv file will be saved in "/static/download_file/"
